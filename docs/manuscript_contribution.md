# My Contribution to [Paper Title]

## Personal Statement

This repository documents my independent contribution to the manuscript "[Paper Title]." My work centered on Sections 2.6.1, 2.6.2, and the corresponding Results section of the paper, where I performed the functional characterization of candidate lncRNAs.

## Specific Tasks Performed by Me

*   **Methodology:** Designed and implemented the guilt-by-association analysis pipeline.
*   **Data Analysis:**
    *   Processed the initial correlation matrix.
    *   Extracted top co-expressed protein-coding partners for 3,645 lncRNAs.
    *   Performed Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using `clusterProfiler`.
    *   Statistically evaluated and filtered results (FDR < 0.05).
*   **Interpretation:** Inferred the biological functions of 50 high-quality lncRNAs, identifying their strong bias towards immune regulation.
*   **Visualization:** Created all figures and tables related to this functional inference for the manuscript.
*   **Manuscript Writing:** Wrote the methods and results sections pertaining to this analysis.

## Distinction from Other Team Members' Work

Other team members were responsible for:
*   Raw RNA-seq data quality control (FASTQC).
*   Read alignment and quantification.
*   Initial differential expression and correlation analysis.

My work begins where theirs ends, taking the list of correlated lncRNAs and answering the critical question: **"What do these lncRNAs actually do?"**
